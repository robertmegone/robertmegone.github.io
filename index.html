He is an extremely hard and thorough worker, who knows the gaming design process by heart. His concise and detailed feedback were the necessary tools to get the best of our soon to be finished game. We hope he will be willing to work with us in future, and we sincerely recommend him as a key part for every team no matter how big or small."<br></p>

                        "Robert came in near the end of development for QA on our latest game, and our only regret was that we didn't hire him sooner. He was extremely thorough, responsive, and, best of all, really cared about the game itself. At a point in development where we had so little time, it was a relief to be able to rely on his testing, and it's thanks to him that we had such a stable release. We loved working with Robert and hope to do so on future projects as well!"<br></p>
